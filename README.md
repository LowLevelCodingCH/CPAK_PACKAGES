# CPAK_PACKAGES
The packages of CPAK are located here for manual download, yes, i fucking use github as my API, you can cringe, i am too lazy to fucking port forward my shitty computer on my damn router. + OPEN SOURCE LIVES MATTER
When you upload a Package to me and i add it, this is what will happen:

1: Compression (maybe):
Your file will be compressed into the .zip format (maybe)
2: upload in the PKG/<name> directory
